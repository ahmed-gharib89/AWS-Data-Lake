# AWS Spark Data Lake

## Overview

- This porject is a part of [Become a Data Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027) at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com)

- The project is about building a Data Lake using AWS and Spark.

## Dataset

Two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each

- Song data: `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`

- Log data: `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`

### Song Dataset

- The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/) Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

> song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json</br>
> song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```json
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

### Log Dataset

- The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

> song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json</br>
> song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

### Schema for Song Play Analysis

Using the song and log datasets, created a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

#### Fact Table

**songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong

- songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

#### Dimension Tables

**users** - users in the app

- user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level

**songs** - songs in music database

- song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration

**artists** - artists in music database

- artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude

**time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units

- start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

### ETL process

In order to acheive this database schema we followed a seriese of steps to reach the above schema:

We first load the data from S3 bucket then tranform it as needed using spark dataframe methods</br>
and then we export the tranformed tables with the new schema to S3 bucket,

### How to run

In order to run this project you will need AWS account and to create user with admin permesions</br>
and a python installed.

Then you will need to update dl.cfg with the AWS Secret key id and Access key</br>
then you can run

```bash
python etl.py
```
